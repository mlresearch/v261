abstract: Polyamides, or peptides and proteins, are biomolecules that exist in a broad
  spectrum of size, structure, and function. Both structure and function are defined
  by the underlying sequence of amino acids, causing the polyamide to take three-dimensional
  conformations when in solution. Despite significant efforts and advances in function
  and conformation prediction, there remains a critical need for computational methods
  to accurately infer protein function from sequence and structure. Recent advancements
  in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks, have shown promise in learning
  the sequence and structure of proteins. However, they fail to capture essential
  long-range dependencies inherent in the complex and dynamic three-dimensional structures
  of proteins, leading to issues including oversquashing and oversmoothing. Here,
  we explore solutions to the challenge of capturing long-range dependencies in graph
  representations of polyamides, focusing on latent nodes and graph rewiring techniques.
  While graph rewiring enhances information flow between distant nodes, latent nodes
  enable the concentration of global information. In addition, we investigate the
  effectiveness of ChebNet, a spectral backbone, in capturing long-range dependencies.
  Our unified framework combines these approaches to address the limitations of current
  methods, offering insights into protein function and regulation. Through experimental
  analysis, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods in capturing long-range
  dependencies.
