abstract: Predicting a ligandâ€™s bound pose to a target protein is a key component
  of early-stage computational drug discovery. Recent developments in machine learning
  methods have focused on improving pose quality at the cost of model runtime. For
  high-throughput virtual screening applications, this exposes a capability gap that
  can be filled by moderately accurate but fast pose prediction. To this end, we developed
  QUICKBIND, a light-weight pose prediction algorithm. We assess QUICKBIND on widely
  used benchmarks and find that it provides an attractive trade-off between model
  accuracy and runtime. To facilitate virtual screening applications, we augment QUICKBIND
  with a binding affinity module and demonstrate its capabilities for multiple clinically-relevant
  drug targets. Finally, we investigate the mechanistic basis by which QUICKBIND makes
  predictions and find that it has learned key physicochemical properties of molecular
  docking, providing new insights into how machine learning models generate protein-ligand
  poses. By virtue of its simplicity, QUICKBIND can serve as both an effective virtual
  screening tool and a minimal test bed for exploring new model architectures and
  innovations. Model code and weights are available at this GitHub repository.
