abstract: Genetic, molecular, and environmental factors influence diseases through
  complex interactions with genes, phenotypes, and drugs. Current methods often fail
  to integrate diverse multi-relational biological data meaningfully, limiting the
  discovery of novel risk genes and drugs. To address this, we present MedGraphNet,
  a multi-relational Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to infer relationships
  among drugs, genes, diseases, and phenotypes. MedGraphNet initializes nodes using
  informative embeddings from existing text knowledge, allowing for robust integration
  of various data types and improved generalizability. Our results demonstrate that
  MedGraphNet matches and often outperforms traditional single-relation approaches,
  particularly in scenarios with isolated or sparsely connected nodes. The model shows
  generalizability to external datasets, achieving high accuracy in identifying disease-gene
  associations and drug-phenotype relationships. Notably, MedGraphNet accurately inferred
  drug side effects without direct training on such data. Using Alzheimerâ€™s disease
  as a case study, MedGraphNet successfully identified relevant phenotypes, genes,
  and drugs, corroborated by existing literature. These findings demonstrate the potential
  of integrating multi-relational data with text knowledge to enhance biomedical predictions
  and drug repurposing for diseases.
