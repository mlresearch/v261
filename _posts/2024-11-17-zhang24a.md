abstract: 'Network inference, the task of reconstructing interactions in a complex
  system from experimental observables, is a central yet extremely challenging problem
  in systems biology. While much progress has been made in the last two decades, network
  inference remains an open problem. For systems observed at steady state, limited
  insights are available since temporal information is unavailable and thus causal
  information is lost. Two common avenues for gaining causal insights into system
  behaviour are to leverage temporal dynamics in the form of trajectories, and to
  apply interventions such as knock-out perturbations. We propose an approach for
  leveraging both dynamical and perturbational single cell data to jointly learn cellular
  trajectories and power network inference. Our approach is motivated by min-entropy
  estimation for stochastic dynamics and can infer directed and signed networks from
  time-stamped single cell snapshots.  '
