abstract: Changes in the number of copies of certain parts of the genome, known as
  copy number alterations (CNAs), due to somatic mutation processes are a hallmark
  of many cancers. This genomic complexity is known to be associated with poorer outcomes
  for patients but describing its contribution in detail has been difficult. Copy
  number alterations can affect large regions spanning whole chromosomes or the entire
  genome itself but can also be localised to only small segments of the genome and
  no methods exist that allow this multi-scale nature to be quantified. In this paper,
  we address this using Wave-LSTM, a signal decomposition approach designed to capture
  the multi-scale structure of complex whole genome copy number profiles. Using wavelet-based
  source separation in combination with deep learning-based attention mechanisms.
  We show that Wave-LSTM can be used to derive multi-scale representations from copy
  number profiles which can be used to decipher sub-clonal structures from single-cell
  copy number data and to improve survival prediction performance from patient tumour
  profiles.
