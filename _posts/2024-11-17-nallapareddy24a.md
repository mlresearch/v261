abstract: Translation elongation plays an important role in regulating protein concentrations
  in the cell, and dysregulation of this process has been linked to several human
  diseases. In this study, we use data from ribo-seq experiments to model ribosome
  densities, and in turn, predict the speed of translation. The proposed method, RiboGL,
  combines graph and recurrent neural networks to account for both graph and sequence-based
  features. The model takes a graph representing the secondary structure of the mRNA
  sequence as input, which incorporates both sequence and structural codon neighbors.
  In our experiments, RiboGL greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art RiboMIMO model
  for ribosome density prediction. We also conduct ablation studies to justify the
  design choices made in building the pipeline. Additionally, we use gradient-based
  interpretability to understand how the codon context and the structural neighbors
  affect the ribosome density at the A-site. By individually analyzing the genes in
  the dataset, we elucidate how structural neighbors could also potentially play a
  role in defining the ribosome density. Importantly, since these neighbors can be
  far away in the sequence, a recurrent model alone could not easily extract this
  information. This study lays the foundation for understanding how the mRNA secondary
  structure can be exploited for ribosome density prediction, and how in the future
  other graph modalities such as features from the nascent polypeptide can be used
  to further our understanding of translation in general.
