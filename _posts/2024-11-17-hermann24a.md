abstract: 'Pretrained protein language models are becoming increasingly popular as
  a backbone for protein property inference tasks such as structure prediction or
  function annotation, accelerating biological research. However, related research
  oftentimes does not consider the effects of data leakage from pretraining on the
  actual downstream task, resulting in potentially unrealistic performance estimates.
  Reported generalization might not necessarily be reproducible for proteins highly
  dissimilar from the pretraining set.  In this work, we measure the effects of data
  leakage from protein language model pretraining in the domain of protein thermostability
  prediction. Specifically, we compare two different dataset split strategies: a pretraining-aware
  split, designed to avoid similarity between pretraining data and the held-out test
  sets, and a commonly-used naive split, relying on clustering the training data for
  a downstream task without taking the pretraining data into account. Our experiments
  suggest that data leakage from language model pretraining shows consistent effects
  on melting point prediction across all experiments, distorting the measured performance
  by an average 11.1% compared to the pretraining-aware split. The source code and
  our dataset splits are available at https://gitlab.com/dacs-hpi/pretraining-aware-hotprot.'
