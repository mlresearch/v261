abstract: Human gene interaction networks, commonly known as interactomes, encode
  genesâ€™ functional relationships, which are invaluable knowledge for translational
  medical research and the mechanistic understanding of complex human diseases. Advanced
  network embedding techniques have inspired recent efforts to identify novel human
  disease-associated genes using canonical interactome embeddings. However, a pivotal
  challenge persists as many complex diseases manifest in specific biological contexts,
  such as tissues or cell types, while many existing interactomes do not encapsulate
  such information. Here, we propose CONE (\url{https://github.com/krishnanlab/cone}),
  a versatile approach to generate context-specific embeddings from any context-free
  interactomes. The core component of CONE consists of a graph attention network with
  contextual conditioning, which is trained in a noise-contrastive fashion using contextualized
  interactome random walks localized around contextual genes. We demonstrate the strong
  performance of CONE embeddings in identifying disease-associated genes when using
  known associated biological contexts to the diseases. Furthermore, our approach
  offers new insights into the biological contexts associated with human diseases.
