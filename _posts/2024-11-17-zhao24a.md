abstract: The computational prediction and design of peptide binders targeting specific
  epitopes within disordered protein regions is crucial in biological and biomedical
  research, yet it remains challenging due to their highly dynamic nature and the
  scarcity of experimentally solved binding data. To address this problem, we built
  an unprecedentedly large-scale library of peptide pairs within stable secondary
  structures (beta sheets), leveraging newly available AlphaFold predicted structures.
  We then developed a machine learning method based on the Transformer architecture
  for the design of specific linear binders, in analogy to a language translation
  task. Our method, TransformerBeta, accurately predicts specific beta strand interactions
  and samples sequences with beta-sheet-like molecular properties, while capturing
  interpretable physico-chemical interaction patterns. As such, it can propose specific
  candidate binders targeting disordered regions for experimental validation to inform
  protein design.
